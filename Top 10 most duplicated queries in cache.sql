/*
top 10 most duplicated queries in cache
plus for each one, 10 sample texts, plans, and a more-info query for sp_BlitzCache to let you slice & dice them by reads, CPU, etc. 
Note that the “Total” numbers like Total_Reads and Total_CPU_ms are for ALL of the different executions of the query text, not just the one line you’re looking at.
I’m filtering for only queries that have at least 100 duplicate entries in the plan cache.
